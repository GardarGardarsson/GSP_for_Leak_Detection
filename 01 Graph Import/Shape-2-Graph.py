Veitur have supplied shapefiles for the district metered area (DMA) of √Ålftanes

`./graph_data/alftanes_shp/Export_Output.shp`

Shapefiles are a data structure that stores the coordinates of line objects.
We shall now see if this data can be turned into a graph of the `networkx` library.

We will first be reading the `.shp` files into a `geopandas` dataframe. 
From that dataframe, we'll try constructing the `networkx` graph using the `momepy` package

We now read the shapefile for the district metered area into a dataframe
Water distribution network, abbr. `wdn`.
'''
wdn = gpd.read_file('./graph_data/alftanes_shp/Export_Output.shp')

'''
The coordinate system can be set to `EPSG 3857`, which is widely supported by 
openly accessible map tile providers

wdn = wdn.to_crs(epsg=3857)


'''
We have to convert this LineString geopandas dataframe (geo-dataframe, `gdf`) to `networkx.Graph`.<br> 
We use `momepy.gdf_to_nx` to convert geo-dataframe to `networkx`graph.<br>
To convert a graph back to a geo-dataframe one uses `momepy.nx_to_gdf`. 
The former, `gdf_to_nx`, supports both primal and dual graphs. <br>

- **Primal** approach will save length of each segment to be used as a weight later
- **Dual** will save the angle between segments (allowing angular centrality).

Let's go with the *primal* approach for now and see how it goes

graph = momepy.gdf_to_nx(wdn, approach='primal')

1. We'll plot the base geometry from the shapefile contained in the geo-dataframe
2. The graph constructed from the geo-dataframe
3. An overlay of the graph on the actual WDN
