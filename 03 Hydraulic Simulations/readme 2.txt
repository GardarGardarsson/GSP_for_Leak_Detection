This folder hosts the directory:

	BattLeDIM

Which is where the BattLeDIM dataset (i.e. the files retrieved at: https://zenodo.org/record/4017659#.YORbDxP7S3I) should be stored.

I also put the directory:

	EPYNET

Here, but won't be uploading it to GitHub.
This is a library for handling EPANET in Python and can be downloaded from: https://github.com/Vitens/epynet
