# GSP for Leak Detection
**Graph Signal Processing** (GSP) refers to a branch of **signal processing** models and algorithms that handle data supported on graphs.

This research project will investigate the application of graph-signal processing methods in **water distribution networks** (WDN) with the objective of detecting and localising leaks.

This `GitHub` repository will be used for version management, development and sharing of code by the researcher, *Gardar Orn Gardarsson*, with the project's supervisors, *Dr. Francesca Boem* and *Dr. Laura Toni*.

**Geographical Information System** (GIS) data, in the `shapefile` data format, is used for the creation of a `networkx` graph, the result of which is shown in the figure above.

This graph will serve as the basis for the coming signal processing, and will support time-series data, for the localisation of leaks.
